## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me sharpen my skills in using APIs :)

### Continued development

For know, I have used Javascript 'fetch' alone for making API calls, I would like to update it using Javascript 'async', 'await';

### Useful resources

- [Geo Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org/) - This helped me to get location based on IP addresses. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [LeafLet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) - This is an amazing tool which helped me to render maps based on IP latitude and longitude.
